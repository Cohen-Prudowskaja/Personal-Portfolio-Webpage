        <h4>About Me:</h4>
        <p>I'm a Bachelor of Science student at the University of North Georgia majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about programming and creating things that add value to peopleâ€™s lives. I learn best by doing, which programming makes possible.
<br>
<br>
In school, while growing up, my classroom's computer had a game called Oregon Trail installed. It amazed me what this machine, was capable of doing. The next year, my uncle gave us an old Macintosh II, and I've been hooked on computers ever since. From that moment, I knew that I wanted to work with computers.
<br>
<br>
Over the next few years, I witnessed the evolution of PC gaming and computers. The internet astounded me. I loved that one could talk instantly over the web with others and that information was so readily available with a simple search.
<br><br>
Recently, I have awakened my interest in web development. I started by taking some courses and exploring what it takes to create a good program. In my studies, I have appreciated the structure and rules in programming. It makes sense for code to be organized and consistent and not abstract.</p>
